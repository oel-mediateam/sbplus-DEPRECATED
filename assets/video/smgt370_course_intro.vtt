00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.740
Hello.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.585
My name is Doctor Mei Cao.

4
00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:10.454
I will be teaching SMGT 370--

5
00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.920
Logistics, Supply Chain
Management, and

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.800
Sustainability.

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.180
I'm an Associate Professor of
Transportation and Logistics

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.156
at the University of
Wisconsin-Superior.

9
00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:25.590
At UWS, I teach Supply Chain
Management, Advanced Supply

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.730
Chain Management, Land
Transportation, Aero

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.580
Transportation, Business
Statistics, and Quantitative

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.970
Models for Protection and
Operations Management.

13
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.230
SMGT 370 is about supply
chain management.

14
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.350
What is supply chain
management?

15
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.430
What am I going to try
and teach you in

16
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.470
this particular course?

17
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.390
Supply chain management has
been one of the strongest

18
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.520
growing fields in business
management in the United

19
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.670
States over the past 30 years.

20
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.660
Companies like Walmart have
achieved award dominance not

21
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.120
because of low prices but
because supply chain

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.420
management allows them to
get those low prices.

23
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.880
So the real question is how do
they do this and how do they

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.514
accomplish that?

25
00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:21.530
I intend in this course to
teach you the concepts,

26
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.100
functions, processes, and
objectives of supply chain

27
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.700
management.

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.930
It covers activities involved
in physically moving raw

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.330
materials, inventory, and
finished goods from point of

30
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.120
origin to point of use
or consumption.

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.850
There's purchasing, operations,
logistics, and

32
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.890
integrating these processes
across the whole supply chain.

33
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.430
Then I'm going to add a
component that's not normally

34
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.560
added to the supply chain
management, and that's

35
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.610
creating sustainable supply
chain management operations.

36
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.890
With sustainable supply chain
management operations, you

37
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.360
gain an economic advantage
and you gain a

38
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.759
environmental advantage.

39
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.615
I'm going to talk about
these processes.

40
00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:13.640

41
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.300
Well, it isn't just a matter of
giving you the information.

42
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.240
I'm going to assess how well
you learned it and how well

43
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.042
you integrated these
principles.

44
00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:31.010
By participating in SMGT 370,
you should be able to know how

45
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.980
supply chains operate and their
management, and how

46
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.290
supply chain management impacts
all of the areas and

47
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.580
processes of a firm and its
supply chain partners, and how

48
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.510
managers can improve their
firm's competitive [INAUDIBLE]

49
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.460
by employing the practices
we learn in this course.

50
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.070
And you should be able to know
what is the relationship

51
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.330
between supply chain
management and the

52
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.460
sustainability and how
sustainability management can

53
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.600
generate revenue and reduce
cost for organization.

54
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.520
